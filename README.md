# Anti-Money Laundering (AML) w/ IBM

<!--
A typical GitHub repository for a data science project is structured to make the code, data, and documentation easily accessible and understandable. Here’s an example of what a well-organized repo might include:

### 1. **Root Directory**
This is the top level, containing essential files and directories.

#### Example:
```
.
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── data/
├── notebooks/
├── src/
├── models/
├── tests/
├── requirements.txt or environment.yml
├── .gitignore
```

### 2. **README.md**
- A markdown file that provides an overview of the project.
- Contains information about the objectives, approach, datasets, installation steps, how to run the code, and dependencies.

#### Example content:
```markdown
# Project Title

## Project Overview
A brief description of the project, its goals, and the problem you're trying to solve.

## Data
- Source of the dataset(s)
- Description of the data

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda env create -f environment.yml`

## Usage
- Example of how to run the analysis or train models.

## Results
Summary of findings, evaluation metrics, etc.
```

### 3. **LICENSE**
- Specifies the licensing for the project (e.g., MIT, GPL). This is important for sharing code.

### 4. **Data Directory (data/)**
- Stores raw or processed datasets. Often excluded from the repo if large due to GitHub's size limits. Instead, a link to where the data can be downloaded might be provided.
- It's a good practice to include a `README.md` in this folder explaining the structure of the data.

#### Example:
```
data/
├── raw/       # Raw, unprocessed data
├── processed/ # Cleaned, transformed data
```

### 5. **Notebooks Directory (notebooks/)**
- Stores Jupyter notebooks where the exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and other experiments are conducted.
- Naming convention: Numbered or descriptive file names for different stages of the project.

#### Example:
```
notebooks/
├── 01_data_exploration.ipynb
├── 02_feature_engineering.ipynb
├── 03_model_training.ipynb
```

### 6. **Source Code Directory (src/)**
- Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model building, feature engineering, etc.
- Helps modularize the project code and keeps the notebooks clean.
  
#### Example:
```
src/
├── data_preprocessing.py
├── feature_engineering.py
├── model.py
```

### 7. **Models Directory (models/)**
- Contains saved models (e.g., `.pkl`, `.h5` files) and other artifacts like serialized pipelines.

#### Example:
```
models/
├── model_v1.pkl
```

### 8. **Tests Directory (tests/)**
- Contains unit tests for the functions and scripts in the `src/` directory.
- Helps in maintaining code quality and ensuring that the scripts behave as expected.

#### Example:
```
tests/
├── test_data_preprocessing.py
├── test_model.py
```

### 9. **Requirements or Environment File**
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies for the project. These are installed using `pip`.
- **`environment.yml`**: Lists dependencies for a Conda environment.

#### Example (`requirements.txt`):
```text
pandas==1.3.0
scikit-learn==0.24.2
matplotlib==3.4.2
```

#### Example (`environment.yml`):
```yaml
name: data-science-env
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pandas=1.3.0
  - scikit-learn=0.24.2
  - matplotlib=3.4.2
  - jupyterlab
```

### 10. **`.gitignore`**
- A file that specifies which files or directories should not be tracked by Git.
- Often includes data files, environment files, logs, and other non-essential or sensitive data.

#### Example:
```
data/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pkl
.env
```

This structure can vary based on the complexity of the project, but following these conventions ensures that the project is easy to navigate, maintain, and share with others.
